# Apollo's Data Visualization
This is the code used to visualize the data from the [Apollo Data Open Platoform](http://data.apollo.auto/?locale=en-us&lang=en). The following list is the dataset that is code is covered.

- [Laser Point Cloud Obstacle Detection And Classification](http://data.apollo.auto/help?name=data_intro_3d&data_key=lidar_obstacle_label&data_type=0&locale=en-us&lang=en)
- [Road Hackers](http://data.apollo.auto/help?name=data_intro_roadhacker&data_key=road_hackers&data_type=0&locale=en-us&lang=en)

## Lidar Point Cloud Obstacle Detection And Classification
The code that we are using for the visualization of this dataset is under `lidar/` folder. The final version of the code is in the Jupyter notebook. More information about the requirements to run this notebook can be found
within the notebook (preview can be seen on Github).

The `lidar/prototype` folder contains C and Python code that is imeplemented to test the library and the way to read the data from the binary files.

## Road Hackers
The code for this dataset is under `roadhackers/` folder. All the code is in the Jupyter notebook. Please see the preview of the notebook for the necessary requiremnets to run the notebook.
